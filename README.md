# emonLight

## Project

It's a simple home energy monitor for *Raspberry Pi*, optimized for simplicity and cost effectiveness.
Features:
* Power usage levels are read from an standard energy meter with pulse output;
* Power usage is collected and sent to emoncms.org; 
* Able to drive a buzzer for signalling high-level usage with configurable soft and hard thresholds;

## Hardware
* Raspberry Pi
* energy meter with pulse output
* Raspberry's 5V power supply (minimum 1200mA)
* optional buzzer (like this )
* wiring for pulse output asnd buzzer connections

### Raspberry

Any version will do, software has been developed using a Raspberry B+.


### Energy meter

Any energy meter with pulse output is fine, see some examples below:

Information about pulse output can be found here http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks/introduction-to-pulse-counting.

### Buzzer

The buzzer is driven by a simple GPIO 3.3V on/off signal, no PWM handling at this time.
Due to the constraint above, be aware that buzzer must have:
* built-in oscillator
* driven by 3.3V

Here an example of such a buzzer

### Wiring

Pulse output can be directly connected to GPIO pins, be warned that internal pull-up resistance have to be enabled for GPIO pin used.

| Energy meter | Raspberry GPIO |
| S0- | GND PIN |
| S0+ | GPIO PIN |

Default pin for pulse reading is GPIO 17.

Buzzer can be directly connected to GPIO pins.

| Buzzer | Raspberry GPIO |
| PIN - | GND PIN |
| PIN + | GPIO PIN |

There is no default for buzzer pin, therefore you have to explicity configure it in order to enable buzzer functionality.


## Software

Software is written in C. 
Development has been done with [netbeans](www.netbeans.org) connecting to a raspberry B+ device running [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org]), but any other distro will do.
the build system is based on Makefile. 
Program doesn't require special privileges, When it is executed as a daemon it defaults to use system wide configuration in order to be handled by a debian-compatible sytem installed service.
Raspberry GPIO configuraton must be performed before program can be executed, otherwise it will fail asking for root permission.

Needed Libraries:
* [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
* [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/)
* [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/)


### Build and install

* connect to your rasperryPi and open a shell
* install software for C compilation
* install git to download the software

install wiringPi library following instruction [here] (http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)
	
install libraries
    sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev 
	
retrieve source code from github
    git clone github....

build
    cd emonlight
    make

install system service named *emonlight*
    sudo make install

setup configuration for service; default pins are GPIO 17 for pulse output reading and GPIO 3 for buzzer control; if you need different setup you have to change:
* */etc/default/emonlight* which contains GPIO pins and queue configuration
* */etc/emonlight.conf* which contains program settings

start service
    sudo service emonlight start

stop service
    sudo service emonlight stop


### configuration

#### GPIO configuration
Configuration of GPIO pins must be performed before first program execution.

    # configure input pin for reading pulse signal
    gpio -g mode 17 in
    # enable pull-up resistance for GPIO 17
    gpio -g mode 17 up
    # enable interrupt sensing for falling edge signal on GPIO 17 pin
    gpio edge 17 falling
    # configure output pin for buzzer control 
    gpio -g mode 3 out
    # set to zero level buzzer pin
    gpio -g write 3 0
    #export above configuration in order to be handled by program without privileges
    gpio exports

#### queue configuration
Setup is needed for a queue, a value of 2048 is a pretty good default

    sudo echo 2048 > /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max


### configuration file 

*/etc/emonlight.conf* or *$HOME/.emonlight*
